# Bistro API Documentation

Welcome to the Bistro API documentation! This overview provides a summary of the key features and functionalities of our API, designed to facilitate interactions with the Bistro platform.

## Overview

The Bistro API allows developers to seamlessly integrate with our platform, providing essential features for managing customers, reservations, tables, staff, meals, drinks items, and orders. By leveraging our API, developers can enhance restaurant operations and deliver exceptional customer experiences.

## Endpoints

## Usage


1. **Clone the Repository**: This means making a copy of the project from the internet onto your computer. You can do this by typing a command in a special program called a terminal or command prompt. It's like downloading a file.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Before using the project, you need to install some extra tools or programs. These are like pieces of software that help the project work better. You'll need to follow some instructions to install them.

3. **Configure the Database**: The project needs a place to store information, like a digital filing cabinet. You need to set up this filing cabinet and make sure it's organized correctly. You'll need to create a new "filing cabinet" on your computer, and then set it up to work with the project.

4. **Run the Application**: Once everything is set up, you can start using the project. You'll need to start a special program on your computer that makes the project work. It's like turning on a machine.

5. **Access the API Endpoints**: Now that the project is running, you can use it like a website. You can look at different parts of it and interact with it using a special tool called Postman or just a regular web browser. It's like using a map to find your way around a new place.


## API Testing

The API can be thoroughly tested and explored using Postman. We have provided Postman collections and environments to assist in API testing. To begin:

1. Import the provided collections and environments into Postman.
2. Utilize the endpoints in the collections to test the API.
3. Refer to Postman's documentation for additional guidance on using the tool.
